	if gunsInPlay = true, have a form with two dropdown lists, one of players with guns, one of all alive players, so that the mod can declare when someone is shot, and submit the form, which will call the gunshot() function

	in a separate form for the lynch, have one dropdown beside each each alive player's name containing every alive player's name. This way the mod can select for each player, which player they vote for. Upon being submitted it will call a function which determines who is lynched  (this is only necessary if we want to implement roles like diplomat and hated, and want to have a point scoring system that takes into consideration how people vote. it would also just be nice to have for game records)
